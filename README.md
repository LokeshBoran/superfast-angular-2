# Superfast Angular 2 setup

A super simple setup for Angular 2 for prototyping or playing around (built for [Telerik Developer Network article here](http://developer.telerik.com/content-types/tutorials/super-fast-setup-angular-2-components-component-router)). Components, TypeScript and Routing setup. No build processes or messing about.

> This isn't a boilerplate I'd recommend using to kickstart your next Angular 2 project with, it was built to demonstrate how to create the barebones needed to bootstrap an Angular 2 application with Components, Views and Routing.

### Running the app

Just clone the repo and run a local server with whatever IDE/tool you want, such as Python on the command line:

```
cd superfast-angular-2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
